abstract: "The emergence of social media and ecommerce platforms enabled the perpetrator to spread negativity and abuse individuals or organisations worldwide rapidly. It is critical to detect hate speech in both visual and textual content so that it may be moderated or excluded from online platforms to keep it sound and safe for users. However, multimodal hate speech detection is a complex and challenging task as people sarcastically present hate speech and different modalities i.e., image and text are involved in their content. This paper describes our participation in the CASE 2023 multimodal hate speech event detection task. In this task, the objective is to automatically detect hate speech and its target from the given textembedded image. We proposed a transformerbased multimodal hierarchical fusion model to detect hate speech present in the visual content. We jointly fine-tune a language and a vision pre-trained transformer models to extract the visual-contextualized features representation of the text-embedded image. We concatenate these features and fed them to the multisample dropout strategy. Moreover, the contextual feature vector is fed into the BiLSTM module and the output of the BiLSTM module also passes into the multi-sample dropout. We employed arithmetic mean fusion to fuse all sample dropout outputs that predict the final label of our proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method obtains competitive performance and ranked 5th among the participants."
