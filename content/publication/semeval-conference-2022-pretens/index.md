abstract: "Recognizing lexical relationships between words is one of the formidable tasks in computational linguistics. It plays a vital role in the improvement of various NLP tasks. However, the diversity of word semantics, sentence structure as well as word order information make it challenging to distill the relationship effectively. To address these challenges, SemEval-2022 Task 3 introduced a shared task PreTENS focusing on semantic competence to determine the taxonomic relations between two nominal arguments. This paper presents our participation in this task where we proposed an approach through exploiting an ensemble of multilingual transformer methods. We employed two fine-tuned multilingual transformer models including XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT to train our model. To enhance the performance of individual models, we fuse the predicted probability score of these two models using weighted arithmetic mean to generate a unified probability score. The experimental results showed that our proposed method achieved competitive performance among the participantsâ€™ methods."
